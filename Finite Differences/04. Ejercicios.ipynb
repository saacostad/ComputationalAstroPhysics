    "Numerical differentiation serves as the essential bridge between theoretical physics—often expressed as continuous differential equations—and the discrete datasets obtained through observations or high-performance simulations. In computational astrophysics, we approximate derivatives by constructing \"stencils\" that sample the function at discrete grid points.\n",

    "While these formulas can be derived via Lagrange Interpolation (approximating the function with a polynomial that passes through specific data points), they are most commonly conceptualized using Taylor Series Expansions.

This occurs because the symmetry of the centered stencil causes the $h^1$ error terms in the Taylor expansion to cancel out exactly, leaving the $h^2$ term as the leading order of error.\n",
